## Visualizing Algorithms

This is an exercise to better understand the ways algorithms work internally and if we can visualize it in a manner that is both pedagogical and aesthetically pleasing.

The inspiration for this is Robert Sedgewick's visualizations in his books/lectures and [algorithms](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/) as visualized by Mike Bostock using d3.js.
